# MVP Team Structure and Work Breakdown Strategy

## Guiding Principles
- Small, cross-functional teams
- Minimal coordination overhead
- Clear ownership
- Speed over perfection during MVP

---

## MVP Phase: Team Breakdown

### Goal
Validate the product quickly with the smallest effective team while maintaining acceptable reliability.

---

## Product Development Team (4 Developers)

### Responsibilities
- Frontend development (web/mobile responsive UI)
- Backend development (APIs, business logic)
- Database design and implementation
- Third-party integrations
- Basic testing and bug fixing

### Rationale
A single cross-functional team minimizes handoffs, enables rapid iteration, and keeps accountability clear during the MVP stage.

---

## Design Team (1–2 Designers)

### Responsibilities
- UX/UI design and user flows
- Mobile responsiveness
- Basic brand identity (colors, typography, visual language)
- Design handoff and collaboration with developers

### Rationale
Design quality is essential early, but specialization is unnecessary at MVP scale.

---

## DevOps / Infrastructure (1 Engineer – Part-Time or Shared)

### Responsibilities
- Initial infrastructure setup
- CI/CD pipelines
- Environment management (dev, staging, prod)
- Monitoring and basic scalability planning

### Rationale
Infrastructure is kept intentionally lightweight while ensuring reliable deployments and a clear path to scale.

---

## Summary

The MVP team structure prioritizes speed, learning, and simplicity. By keeping teams small and cross-functional, the organization can validate assumptions quickly while maintaining sufficient technical quality to evolve into a production-ready system.
